---

To start up RETEFOOP from the listener, type:

	?- load([retefoop,retepred]).   
	?- main.

At the command prompt in OOPS there are four options, LOAD, GO, LIST
and EXIT.  

LOAD    expects the name of a file, since it reads a Prolog term the
	file name must be enclosed in single quotes and ended with a period.

COMPILE compiles rules into a rete network.

DISPLAYNET displays the rete network.

GO      starts the inferencing, and, at least with the ROOM.OKB knowledge 
	base begins a dialog initiated by the knowledge base.

LIST    lists working memory.

OPTIONS allows the setting of message levels.

EXIT    ends the session.
