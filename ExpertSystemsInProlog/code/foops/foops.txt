ABOUT
-----

FOOPS adds a frame system to OOPS for added data representation.


USE
---

To start up FOOPS from the listener, type:

	?- load(foops). 
	?- main.

At the command prompt in FOOPS there are four options, LOAD, GO, LIST
and EXIT.  

LOAD    expects the name of a file, since it reads a Prolog term the
	file name must be enclosed in single quotes and ended with a period.

GO      starts the inferencing, and, at least with the ROOM.OKB knowledge 
	base begins a dialog initiated by the knowledge base.

LIST    lists working memory.

EXIT    ends the session.
